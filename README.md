The present repository includes two files:
Both files were designed to run in Google Colaboratory online Python environment

1.- The file nilearn_plot_connectome.py is a script that plots the Power atlas (a brain atlas comprising 264 brain nodes). 
Each node of this atlas is drawn in blue color except the nodes comprising the DAN, that are printed in red. A set of edges are printed as well. Specifically,
the edges that most significantly differentiate between children with and without dyslexia between the DAN and the rest of the brain.
 
2.- The file Dyslexia_Detection.py is a Machine Learning model that runs a classification between children with and without dyslexia. Further details of this model are 
presented in the paper "Distinct connectivity patterns between perception and attention-related brain networks characterize dyslexia: machine learning applied to resting-state fMRI",
that is to be published in the journal cortex. A DOI identification number for this paper is to be created soon.
